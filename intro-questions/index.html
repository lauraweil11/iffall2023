        <h1>Get to Know Me!</h1>

        <ol>
            <b><li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li></b>
            <p>Hi! My name is Laura Weil and I'm a senior majoring in Global Studies and Communication Design with a minor in Theater.</p>
           
            <b><li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li></b>
            <p>With my Communication Design second major, this class was obviously a requirement, but I also wanted to make sure I had a basic understanding of this area of design to be a more well-rounded designer. Also, most of my friends study Computer Science, so I feel like I should at least sort of understand what they do.</p>
           
            <b><li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li></b>
            <p>I have no experience, but I'm excited to learn!</p>
           
            <b><li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li></b>
            <p>Since I'm coming into this class with no experience, I know I'll learn a lot, but I'm most excited to see how I can do some extra research so I can add some fun elements to my projects, and I'm excited to feel more comfortable with these processes.</p>
          
            <b><li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li></b>
            <p>Designing for the screen has the extra challenge of creating things that work on different screens, such as phones vs computers. Also, I think the method and process of design and experimentation will be different, as testing new ideas happens in very different ways.</p>

            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p>I think the <a href="https://www.paris2024.org/en/">Paris 2024 Olympics website</a> has a strong focus on design, as its purpose is not just to communicate information easily, but also to showcase the branding system for the 2024 Games. It is easy to navigate and reacts to the cursor in interesting ways.</p>

            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times website</a> is designed to show lots of information at once, without being too overwhelming. I believe it does a good job of clearly communicating key articles through various methods of designing hierarchy, while still having clear headers to more information and enough white space so it remains legible.</p>

            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">The WWF webpage</a> does a great job of balancing photography, statistics, headlines, and small graphics, leaving room for visual rest. While the goal of the webiste is likely to generate donations, it does so not by immediately showing this request, but by clearly introducing the viewer to recent headlines that highlight the importance of their work, what this work is, and ways to engage further (including donation).</p>
