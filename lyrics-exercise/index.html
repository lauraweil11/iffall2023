            I wanna go to New Zealand, did I tell you that? <br>
            I wanna go someplace and never come back <br>
            Do I wanna stay close or fly away? <br>
            It's too late to stay away

            I'll take a one-way ticket to go to Congo, Oslo, Tokyo <br>
            I will go anywhere you go <br>
            I'll take a one-way ticket to go to Congo, Oslo, Tokyo <br>
            I will go anywhere you go

            But I woke up in Santa Barbara with the sun, sun on my face <br>
            Not sure where I'm going, but I know it'll be okay <br>
            I had to leave you, pack my suitcase and go <br>
            Cause if I never left this little town, I'd be stuck folding your clothes
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll take a one-way ticket to go to Congo, Oslo, Tokyo <br>
            I will go anywhere you go <br>
            I'll take a one-way ticket to go to Congo, Oslo, Tokyo <br>
            I will go anywhere you go 
        </p>

        <p>
            But I woke up in Santa Barbara with the sun, sun on my face <br>
            Not sure where I'm going, but I know it'll be my fate
        </p>

        <p>
            I, I, I wanna lie, lie, lie, say you're my mine, mine, mine <br>
            Cause I'm just so eager for you 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll, I'll take a one-way ticket to you, ticket to you<br>
            I'll, I'll take a one-way ticket to Congo, Oslo, Tokyo<br>
            I'll take a one-way ticket to Congo<br>
            Don't you cry no<br>
            Ticket to Congo, Oslo, Tokyo
